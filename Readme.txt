This portfolio was developed as part of the PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge. While I initially explored the project setup, all development, design, and enhancements were completed during the official challenge period (March 31 â€“ April 4, 2025).
This project showcases a modern, visually stunning, and highly responsive website designed with a strong focus on user experience and aesthetic appeal. The design leverages cutting-edge CSS techniques, animations, and transitions to create an engaging digital experience that adapts seamlessly across devices.
